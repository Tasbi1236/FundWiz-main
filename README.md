# FundWiz
 Fundwiz is an exciting app designed for children to help them keep track of their spending habits. With this innovative app, kids can easily manage their finances, track their spending, and learn valuable lessons about money management. Funwiz uses prices swag as a way to incentivize children to create a habit of tracking their spending, keeping them motivated and engaged throughout the process. Whether it's pocket money, birthday gifts, or allowances, children can easily enter their spending details, which are automatically calculated, and organized into an easy-to-read format.
